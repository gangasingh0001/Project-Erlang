# Loan Management System

## Overview
This project implements a Loan Management System using concurrent programming in Erlang. It consists of three main modules: `customer`, `bank`, and `money`.

## Modules

### 1. `customer`
- **Description:** Manages individual customers seeking loans.
- **Functions:**
  - `spawn_customers/3`: Spawns customer processes based on provided information.

### 2. `bank`
- **Description:** Represents banks handling loan requests and managing balances.
- **Functions:**
  - `spawn_banks/2`: Spawns bank processes based on provided information.

### 3. `money`
- **Description:** Orchestrates the entire loan management system, handling customer-bank interactions.
- **Functions:**
  - `start/1`: Initiates the loan management system by spawning customer and bank processes and coordinating their interactions.
  - `loop/5`: Manages the main control flow and logs relevant information.

## Execution
1. Compile the Erlang modules using the Erlang shell or an integrated development environment.
2. Run the system by calling `money:start/1` with the necessary arguments, providing customer and bank information files.

```bash
money:start(["customer_info.txt", "bank_info.txt"]).

# Loan Management System

## Overview
This project implements a Loan Management System using concurrent programming in Erlang. It consists of three main modules: `customer`, `bank`, and `money`.

## Modules

### 1. `customer`
- **Description:** Manages individual customers seeking loans.
- **Functions:**
  - `spawn_customers/3`: Spawns customer processes based on provided information.

### 2. `bank`
- **Description:** Represents banks handling loan requests and managing balances.
- **Functions:**
  - `spawn_banks/2`: Spawns bank processes based on provided information.

### 3. `money`
- **Description:** Orchestrates the entire loan management system, handling customer-bank interactions.
- **Functions:**
  - `start/1`: Initiates the loan management system by spawning customer and bank processes and coordinating their interactions.
  - `loop/5`: Manages the main control flow and logs relevant information.

## Execution
1. Compile the Erlang modules using the Erlang shell or an integrated development environment.
2. Run the system by calling `money:start/1` with the necessary arguments, providing customer and bank information files.
```

```bash
money:start(["customer_info.txt", "bank_info.txt"]).
Observe the loan approval/denial logs and final banking reports printed by the system.
Input Files

Customer Info File (customer_info.txt): Contains information about customers, including names and loan amounts.
Bank Info File (bank_info.txt): Contains information about banks, including names and initial balances.
Notes

The system employs Erlang's concurrent programming features, with each customer and bank operating as independent processes.
Communication between processes is managed through message passing.
The system utilizes random delays and amounts for a realistic simulation of loan requests.
Disclaimer: This project is a simulated system and may not accurately represent real-world banking processes.
